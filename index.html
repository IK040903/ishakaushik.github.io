          <p>Hi, I'm a second-year neuroscience student at Columbia University, with a focus on neurocognition, education, design and technology. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <a href="https://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/kf2119/" target="_blank">Kay James</a> Initially set on pursuing medicine, I took a detour into clinical, cognitive, and experimental neuroscience research - and fell in love with studying and helping people. But after seeing a research report I co-drafted for months, aimed at improving sleep center programs in New Delhi, get stuck in academic politics, I decided not to take the traditional academia route either. I wrapped up my undergrad and started grad school in the U.S. at 20. Fell in love again - this time with how real-world products built on science, creativity, and conviction can actually improve lives at scale. Now, I‚Äôm combining my two hearts to build something useful. Currently at Columbia, researching, tinkering, and having deep conversations about human behavior.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p class="section-intro">
        My background in neuroscience taught me that every design speaks to the brain - and every piece of technology, in turn, shapes how we think, feel, and connect. That realization made me see technology not just as a tool, but as a language with both communicative power and responsibility.
<br>
I believe design and development should serve as bridges between cognition and creation - speaking for those whose voices or perspectives are often overlooked. Through this lens, I aim to build technologies that understand people as deeply as people understand technology.

I‚Äôm eager to keep learning, collaborating, and building projects that merge empathy, science, and design to make intelligence more human and impact more accessible. 
            Don't hesitate to <a href="ik2583@tc.columbia.edu" target=_blank>reach out for collab :D</a>
